Medium Slider
=============
Checkout the [demo](http://sudharti.github.io/medium-slider.js/)

A simple sliding panel to display off-canvas contents. The panel pushes the exiting body content to the right and smoothly transitions into the view area. This addon uses css transforms (translate3d) and cubic bezier transitions to achieve the sliding effect.
